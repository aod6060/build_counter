# Build Counter

This is a simple utility that will work in conjuction with a library I'm currently 
working on. I'll add more information about this library in a future date so this page will be updated to reflect that. Basically this little too will create a binary file that stores build
information.

I'll add in a tutorial for this tool as soon as I finish my library which will be soon.


Also like the library it will be under the mit license (see LICENSE for more details) so feel free to copy and 
have some fun with this very benign tool. Also for now I'm only supporting linux, however, once I finish the library portion of this project I'll port it to windows as well.
